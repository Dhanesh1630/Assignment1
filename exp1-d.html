<h2> We need a good diet plan for faster growth of muscles</h2>
    <p>A good diet is vital for muscle growth as it provides essential nutrients like proteins for muscle repair,
    carbohydrates for energy, and healthy fats for hormone production.
    Vitamins and minerals support muscle function and recovery.
    Without proper nutrition, muscles can't recover or grow effectively,
    leading to slower progress and potential injuries.
    A balanced diet complements a workout routine,
    optimizing muscle gains and overall fitness.</p>

<h2>To get better physic compared to others we should follow a proper workout schedule</h2>
	<p> A good workout schedule is essential for muscle growth as it ensures consistent and balanced training,
	targeting all muscle groups effectively. 
	It incorporates various exercises for hypertrophy,
	strength, and endurance, while preventing overtraining and injuries through adequate rest periods. 
	This structured approach aids in tracking progress and maintaining motivation, 
	leading to more efficient muscle growth.</p>
